            <h3>Documentation for our products</h3>
            Sprocket Tools delivers quality SharePoint web parts and administrative tools at an affordable price.  By providing effective SharePoint components we allow administrators and users to focus on more important tasks rather than worrying about implementing gaps in commonly requested functionality.
            <br /><br />
            Sprocket Tools also provides custom SharePoint development.  We can offer significant discounts on custom development if the client allows us to resell what we develop.  If you need something developed just contact one of our sales engineers to discuss what solution will work best for you and your organization.
